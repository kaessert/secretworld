# Implementation Summary: CLAUDE.md

## Status: COMPLETE

Created the CLAUDE.md file for AI-assisted development documentation.

## What Was Implemented

Created `/CLAUDE.md` at the project root with the following sections:

1. **Quick Project Overview**: Brief description of the CLI RPG project
2. **Testing Commands**: How to run tests (full suite, specific modules, with coverage)
3. **Project Structure**: Complete tree of `src/cli_rpg/` with file descriptions
4. **Key Architectural Patterns**: Grid-based world, GameState, AI integration, dataclasses
5. **Coding Standards**: Python 3.9+, line length 100, type hints, black/ruff
6. **Running the Game**: How to start the game

## Files Created

- `CLAUDE.md` (project root)

## Verification

- Verified file exists and content is accurate
- Cross-referenced with actual project structure via `Glob` and `pyproject.toml`
- All modules listed in the structure exist in `src/cli_rpg/`

## No Tests Required

This was a documentation-only task with no code functionality to test.
