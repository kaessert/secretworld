# Current Status: Project Health Assessment

## Summary

The CLI RPG project is in excellent health:
- **100% test coverage** across all 24 modules (2925 statements)
- **1385 tests passing**, 1 skipped
- **No active issues** in ISSUES.md
- **No TODOs/FIXMEs** in codebase
- Clean linting (ruff errors resolved)

## Recommendation

Since there are no outstanding issues or coverage gaps, the next step requires **stakeholder input** to determine the next feature priority.

### Potential Feature Areas (for discussion)

1. **Multiplayer/Networking** - Add co-op or PvP elements
2. **Crafting System** - Combine items to create new equipment
3. **Skills/Abilities** - Special attacks with cooldowns
4. **Achievements** - Track player milestones
5. **Dungeon Generation** - Multi-room combat challenges
6. **Character Classes** - Warrior, Mage, Rogue archetypes with unique abilities

## Action Required

No implementation can proceed without feature selection. Consult with project stakeholders to identify the next user-facing enhancement.
