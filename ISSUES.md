## Active Issues

### Game should ALWAYS SAVE

### Player still gets stuck as world created has only two locations and has an issue that it is not atuomatically expanding from there on. Also it has always only exactlly two exits. Initial world generation and further world generation logic should most probably be more sohpisticated
