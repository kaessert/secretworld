## Resolved Issues

### Map misaligned and confusing
**Status**: RESOLVED

The map alignment issue with colored markers has been fixed. The player's `@` marker now aligns correctly with column headers and other location markers. Additionally, available exits are now displayed below the map legend (e.g., "Exits: east, north").
