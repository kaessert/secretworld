## Active Issues

### AI-generated content expansion
**Status**: ACTIVE

Remaining AI-generated content to implement:
- Lore and world history

**Completed:**
- ✅ NPC conversations (AI-generated dialogue that persists to NPC greetings)
- ✅ Monsters/enemies (AI-generated with descriptions and attack flavor text)
- ✅ Item catalogue (weapons, armor, consumables) - `AIService.generate_item()` method

## Resolved Issues

### Map misaligned and confusing
**Status**: RESOLVED

The map alignment issue with colored markers has been fixed. The player's `@` marker now aligns correctly with column headers and other location markers. Additionally, available exits are now displayed below the map legend (e.g., "Exits: east, north").
