## Active Issues

### Unknown command error message is incomplete
**Status**: OPEN

**Problem Description**: When a user enters an unknown command during exploration, the error message doesn't list all available commands. Specifically, it's missing `talk`, `shop`, `buy`, and `sell`.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Start the game and create a new character
2. Enter an unknown command like `help` or `?`
3. Observe the error message

**Expected Behavior**: Error message should list all available commands:
```
✗ Unknown command. Type 'look', 'go', 'status', 'inventory', 'equip', 'unequip', 'use', 'talk', 'shop', 'buy', 'sell', 'save', or 'quit'
```

**Actual Behavior**: Error message is missing `talk`, `shop`, `buy`, `sell`:
```
✗ Unknown command. Type 'look', 'go', 'status', 'inventory', 'equip', 'unequip', 'use', 'save', or 'quit'
```

**Impact**: Users may not realize these commands exist, especially since there's no `help` command. This could lead to confusion when trying to interact with NPCs/shops.

## Resolved Issues

### Health potions can be wasted when at full health
**Status**: RESOLVED

**Original Problem**: When a player uses a Health Potion while at full health, the potion is consumed but heals 0 HP. The game shows the message "You used Health Potion and healed 0 health!" and considers this a successful action.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added a check in `Character.use_item()` to verify the player is not at full health before consuming a healing item
- Returns `(False, "You're already at full health!")` when attempting to use a healing potion at full health
- The potion remains in the inventory when rejected
- Added `test_use_health_potion_at_full_health` test to verify the behavior

### Confusing error message when trying to sell equipped items
**Status**: RESOLVED

**Original Problem**: When a player tries to sell an item that is currently equipped, the error message "You don't have 'item name' in your inventory" is confusing and unhelpful.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added check in `main.py` sell command handler to detect when item is equipped
- Now displays helpful message: "You can't sell [Item] because it's currently equipped. Unequip it first with 'unequip weapon'." (or 'unequip armor' for armor items)
- Added tests `test_sell_equipped_weapon_shows_helpful_message` and `test_sell_equipped_armor_shows_helpful_message`

### Documentation inconsistency: "up" and "down" directions
**Status**: RESOLVED

**Original Problem**: The README.md documentation listed "up, down" as valid movement directions, but the grid system uses 2D coordinates only (north, south, east, west).

**Solution Implemented**:
- Removed "up, down" from the README.md `go <direction>` documentation
- README now matches the in-game help which only mentions cardinal directions

### Broken navigation link from Forest to Deep Woods
**Status**: RESOLVED

**Original Problem**: When the player navigates to the Forest (by going north from Town Square), the location shows "Exits: north, south". However, attempting to go north displays an internal error message: "Destination 'Deep Woods' not found in world."

**Solution Implemented**:
- Removed dangling exits from `create_default_world()` in `world.py` that pointed to non-existent locations ("Deep Woods" and "Crystal Cavern")
- Added test `test_default_world_all_exits_have_valid_destinations` to ensure all location exits point to valid destinations in the world
- Forest now only shows "Exits: south" and Cave only shows "Exits: west"

### Grid-based map structure
**Status**: RESOLVED

**Original Problem**: Map should be more logically laid out instead of connecting random locations to each other. There should be a logical representation of the map under the hood like a matrix.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `WorldGrid` class (`src/cli_rpg/world_grid.py`) with coordinate-based storage
- Locations now have optional `coordinates: Tuple[int, int]` field
- Direction offsets ensure spatial consistency: north=(0,+1), south=(0,-1), east=(+1,0), west=(-1,0)
- Moving north then south returns to the same location (geographic consistency)
- Bidirectional connections are automatically created based on coordinates
- Backward compatible with existing saves via `from_legacy_dict()`

**Test Coverage**: 38 new tests verify grid functionality:
- 20 WorldGrid unit tests
- 8 Location coordinate tests
- 10 Integration tests for movement roundtrips and save/load
